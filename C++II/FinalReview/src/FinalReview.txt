//Final Exam is Friday, May 13th, 2pm, in CS lab J-119
//right hand side of lab.  

//I recommend arriving early to make sure that we can login and print without problems.  
//exam lasts two hours

//because you will not be doing a complete project, just print out the code
//you write and turn that in. 

//exam is open book & note, examples will be available on the I:Drive

//questions will come in the following forms 

//		1)  I may give you a class and ask you to write one of the methods for that
//			class such as "Write the copy constructor or assignment operator" 
//			the class may be a template.	
//			I may ask you to make this method vritual or pure virtual. 
					virtual  ~String(); //destructor is virtual
						"the child can write this method, in which case, it will pick up the method
					
					virtual int Func() = 0; //this is pure virtual 
						"I'm not writing this method, but FORCES the child to write" 
	
			
//		2) I may give you a class and ask you to write a child of the class
//		   showing how you would add a method, override a method, or hide/remove a method. 

//	    3) I may ask you to write the code for a method, to do something with an existing class
//		   This may be to show how to work with a file.  Opening & Closing files and such.
